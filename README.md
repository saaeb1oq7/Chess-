## 🎯 Content Summary

### Basics (10 Golden Rules)
1. Develop pieces early and castle
2. Avoid unnecessary pawn moves
3. Knights before bishops
4. Don't announce check if opponent can easily defend
5. Don't move same piece twice in opening
6. Don't open position if behind in development
7. Queen behind pawns (2nd rank for white)
8. Kingside castle is safer
9. Don't trade developed pieces for undeveloped ones
10. Prevent opponent from castling

### Strategic Principles
- Control center squares (e4, d5, d4, d3)
- Trade in complicated situations or to ruin pawn structure
- Attack the 7th rank
- Bishop vs Knight advantages (open vs closed positions)
- Protect the back rank
- Create and attack weaknesses
